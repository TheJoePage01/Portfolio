            <strong>Hey, I am Joe Page</strong> a 17 year old developer from Nevada, USA. Since I was young I have been passionate about coding and technology.<br> 
            </strong> As a young and ambitious individual, I have been dedicated to learning and expanding my skillset in the field. I started my journey with <strong>Scratch</strong> at the age of 10 and have since learned several programming languages, including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong>. In 2020, I used my knowledge of <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>EJS</strong> to create a replica of the Google Play store where users could rate and upload their own games. This project allowed me to practice my web development skills and create something functional and user-friendly.<br>
            <br>
            I am always looking for ways to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what I can achieve. I am excited to continue my journey in technology and am looking forward to learning <strong>Unreal</strong> in the future. I believe that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to succeed in any challenge I take on.
